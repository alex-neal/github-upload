# setgen

Setgen is a rough prototype Java program that automatically generates a setlist for my cover band, Armstead. It takes as input the band's reportoire data (a CSV file) and parameters for the performance (such as number of sets, set length, and desired music intensity). The output is the desired setlist, along with an optional LaTeX file which can be immediately compiled to generate a PDF.
